       I was born in Marin country 17 years ago and still live here today. I'm a senior at San Rafael High School. This is my personal page, created in my computer programing class.

        I spend most of my time on sports; I play both football and rugby. Additionally, I enjoy videogames and movies. I'm currently looking into my college prospects, and considering computer science options.
